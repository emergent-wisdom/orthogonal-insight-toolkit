# Worked Examples

Three experiments conducted with blind agents (December 2024).

## Example 1: Voter Turnout × BUOYANT

### The Setup
- **Problem:** Low voter turnout in democratic elections
- **Seed:** BUOYANT (randomly selected)
- **Hypothesis:** Standard solutions address friction. What if we addressed commitment?

### World Rules (BUOYANT)
1. Everything naturally rises/floats upward. Gravity is weak.
2. Nothing remains stationary without being tethered or weighted down.
3. Downward movement requires energy; upward movement is free.
4. **Weight symbolizes responsibility and commitment.** Leaders wear heavy chains of office.
5. Age means ascension — the elderly gradually float higher until they drift away.

### In-World Solution: "Council Chamber of Descent"
The agent proposed:
- Build civic chambers **deep underground**
- To participate in decisions, citizens must **physically descend** (requires effort)
- The deeper you go, the heavier the voting tokens you can retrieve
- Vote weight = proportional to effort invested
- Natural filter: the lazy/uncommitted cannot make the descent

> "The descension chambers transform civic participation from an abstract duty into a physical achievement."

### Mechanism Extracted
**Core Principle:** *Commitment-weighted participation through costly signaling*

Make influence proportional to verifiable, non-transferable investment.

**Portability:** PORTABLE

**Bridge to Reality:** Quadratic Commitment Voting
- Tiered participation (1hr → 5hr → 20hr civic engagement)
- Vote weight = √(effort) — diminishes returns on pure resource accumulation
- Floor (everyone gets 1 base vote) + Ceiling (max 10x)
- Domain-specific effort (housing policy = studying zoning laws)

**Precedents:** Colorado Citizens Assembly, Taiwan vTaiwan, Gitcoin Quadratic Funding

### Control Comparison
Standard answer: Automatic registration, early voting, election holidays, mobilization campaigns.

**Key Difference:**
- Control asks: "How do we make voting easier?"
- OIP asks: "How do we make votes reflect actual commitment?"

## Example 2: Antibiotic Resistance × MIRRORED

### The Setup
- **Problem:** Growing antibiotic resistance threatening modern medicine
- **Seed:** MIRRORED (randomly selected)
- **Hypothesis:** Standard solutions reduce antibiotic use. What if we couldn't attack at all?

### World Rules (MIRRORED)
1. All actions create instantaneous, perfect reflections. What you do to another happens to you.
2. Any sensation you cause, you experience simultaneously.
3. To take something, you must give something of equivalent value.
4. **Violence is literally impossible** — every wound is mutual.
5. Societies thrive by designing win-win systems where reflections amplify good.

### In-World Solution: "Symbiotic Enhancement"
The agent realized: *Traditional antibiotics are impossible — harming bacteria would harm you.*

Solution shifts from "destroy the bad" to "empower the good":
1. **Strengthen beneficial microbiomes** to outcompete harmful bacteria
2. **Modify host environment** (pH, temperature) — self-modification, not attack
3. **Chemical signaling** — use quorum sensing to convince bacteria to become dormant
4. **Engineer cooperative bacteria** that outcompete parasitic ones

> "You can't solve problems by fighting. You solve them by designing systems where cooperation outcompetes exploitation."

### Mechanism Extracted
**Core Principle:** *Environmental/systemic optimization makes undesirable behavior non-viable*

Instead of attacking Problem X, modify the system to favor Solution Y, which naturally outcompetes X.

**Portability:** PORTABLE

**Bridge to Reality:**
- Fecal microbiota transplants (already treating C. difficile)
- Quorum sensing disruption research
- Nutrient sequestration therapies
- Immunomodulation approaches

**Diagnostic Value:** Revealed our bias toward direct intervention even when it creates long-term problems. We systematically under-invest in environmental approaches because they're "slower and less satisfying."

### Control Comparison
Standard answer: Stewardship programs, surveillance systems, prescription regulation, prevention.

**Key Difference:**
- Control asks: "How do we use antibiotics more carefully?"
- OIP asks: "What if we couldn't attack pathogens at all?"

## Example 3: Loneliness Epidemic × POROUS

### The Setup
- **Problem:** Epidemic of loneliness and social isolation
- **Seed:** POROUS (randomly selected)
- **Hypothesis:** Standard solutions create connection. What if barriers don't exist?

### World Rules (POROUS)
1. Nothing can maintain absolute boundaries. All barriers are permeable.
2. Everything moves from high concentration to low through any barrier.
3. Similar substances pass more easily (emotions of similar frequency transfer instantly).
4. Once saturated, entities become conduits — radiating outward uncontrollably.
5. **Privacy is exhausting.** Secrets "want" to leak. True isolation doesn't exist.

### In-World Solution: "Flow-Based Healing"
The agent identified a paradox: *In a world where emotions flow freely, how can loneliness exist?*

Answer: **Loneliness itself is the contagion.** People become saturated and radiate loneliness to others, creating a self-sustaining resonance loop.

Solutions:
1. **"Loneliness Composters"** — people trained to absorb and transform loneliness
2. **Frequency disruption** — introduce incompatible emotions (joy, curiosity) to break resonance
3. **Controlled saturation events** — mass discharge where gradients equalize
4. **Make loneliness visible** — reduces energy drain of concealment
5. **Use porousness as mechanism** — train deliberate transmission of non-loneliness

> "You can't solve connection problems with barriers. The epidemic exists because people are trying to use container-thinking in a gradient-flow reality."

### Mechanism Extracted
**Core Principle:** *Loneliness is a transmission problem, not a connection deficit problem*

Address transmission patterns, not connection quantity.

**Portability:** PORTABLE

**Bridge to Reality:**
- Cacioppo's Framingham study (2009): Loneliness spreads through networks like contagion
- Ironic process theory: Suppressing emotions amplifies them
- Trained peer support networks ("Loneliness Composters")
- Nature-based interventions (28% loneliness reduction via incompatible sensory input)
- Group settings where loneliness is named ("Controlled saturation")

### Control Comparison
Standard answer: Social infrastructure, school programs, CBT interventions, national policies, transportation.

**Key Difference:**
- Control asks: "How do we connect lonely people?"
- OIP asks: "What if loneliness spreads through connection itself?"

## Summary: What These Examples Show

| Experiment | Control Frame | OIP Frame | Result |
|------------|---------------|----------|--------|
| Voter Turnout | Reduce friction | Weight by commitment | More novel |
| Antibiotics | Reduce use | Eliminate attack entirely | Complementary |
| Loneliness | Increase connection | Treat as contagion | More novel + research-backed |

**Consistent finding:** The Orthogonal Insight Protocol changed the *question*, not just the answer. The fictional physics forced a reframe before generating solutions.
