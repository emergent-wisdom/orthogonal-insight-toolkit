### Phase 1: World Construction

**Seed:** [SEED WORD]

**World Rules:**
1. [RULE 1]
2. [RULE 2]
3. [RULE 3]
4. [RULE 4]
5. [RULE 5]

**What's Easy in This World:**
-

**What's Hard in This World:**
-

### Phase 2: In-World Solution

**Problem as Presented to Agent:**
[How you framed the problem within the world's physics]

**Solution Generated:**
[Paste or summarize the agent's solution]

**Key Mechanisms Proposed:**
1.
2.
3.

**Core Insight (in agent's words):**
> "[Quote the most interesting insight]"

---

### Phase 3: Mechanism Extraction

**Core Mechanism (Abstract):**
[The principle stripped of fictional physics]

**Portability Label:** [ ] PORTABLE  [ ] INVERSE  [ ] MAGICAL

**Why This Label:**
[Justify your assessment]

**Bridge to Reality:**
[If PORTABLE/INVERSE: How would you implement this in the real world?]

**Existing Precedents:**
[What similar mechanisms already exist?]

---

### Control Comparison (Optional)

**Standard Prompt Used:**
[The "normal" question you asked without world-shifting]

**Control Response Summary:**
1.
2.
3.

**Control vs SP Comparison:**

| Dimension | Control | Simulation Protocol |
|-----------|---------|---------------------|
| Question Asked | | |
| Core Assumption | | |
| Novel Elements | | |
| Practicality | | |

---

### Assessment

**Did SP produce a different frame?** [ ] Yes [ ] No

**Was the mechanism portable?** [ ] Yes [ ] Partially [ ] No

**What did the fictional physics reveal?**
[What assumption did it challenge? What invisible constraint did it make visible?]

**Would you use this mechanism?** [ ] Yes [ ] Maybe [ ] No

**Notes for Future:**
[What would you do differently?]

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] Seed was selected randomly (not cherry-picked)
- [ ] World builder didn't know the problem
- [ ] Solver only saw world rules (not the seed word)
- [ ] Mechanism extractor evaluated honestly
- [ ] Control comparison provides baseline
